# Shift-Cipher-Decryption

In this project I will be breaking the following ciphertext which is encrypted using Shift cipher.

The Shift cipher given a key K encrypts a plain text in a way that each letter in the plain 
text is replaced with the Kth letter in the list of symbols. A list of symbols used for Shift 
cipher is as follows:  
 
`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890 !?,.`
 
This list includes white space and special characters `‘!’, ‘?’, ‘,’, ‘.’.`

# Approach


For this shift cipher project, I will be decrypting the encrypted message using a brute-force attack, created in Python
